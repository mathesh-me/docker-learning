## What is Containers?
Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developer's personal laptop. Containers are also lightweight, so they start up and run faster than virtual machines, making them ideal for microservices and serverless computing. Containers are also portable, so you can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
### Advantages of Containers
* Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
* Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
* Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
* Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
* Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
* Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.
