## What is Container Orchestration?

- Instead of running a single container, we can run multiple containers in a single host or multiple hosts. This is called container orchestration.

- If we run conatiner using docker run command, we can run only one container in a single host. If we want to run multiple containers in a single host, we need to use docker run command multiple times. This is not a good practice. Also we ahve to monitor each container individually. This is not a good practice.

- Container orchestration is the process of automating the management of containerized applications. It's used to control and automate many tasks related to deploying, managing, and scaling containers and the apps they contain.

- Container orchestration tools are used to manage the lifecycles of containers and the applications they contain. They also help to automate the deployment and scaling of containers across clusters of hosts to ensure maximum uptime and optimal performance.
